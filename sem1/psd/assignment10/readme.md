# hypothesis testing experimentation

In this codebase, we are doing a hypothesis test, and we are writing it in `Node.js` and are making use of the [`ttest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttest) library.

This is part of the work on the ninth assignment of the Pengantar Sains Data (Introduction to Data Science) class at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science of the University of Indonesia (FMIPA UI).

## running
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/drepram/college
$ cd college/sem1/psd/assignment9/
$ yarn install # npm would work just as fine
$ node index.js # i know i could've added a `run` command to package.json but that would be too much of a hassle, wouldn't it?
```
