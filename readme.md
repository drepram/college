The documents stored in this repository are creation of Andre Christoga Pramaditya (Student ID: 2006570006) who is currently an undergraduate at the Physics Department at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science of the University of Indonesia (FMIPA UI).

## writing mechanism

I write Markdown, with some help from [`markdown-preview-enhanced`](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/) Math feature.

Directories are in the order `semester/class/assingment/`. 

I usually write the document with the filename `work.md`, put the images and other files in the `assets/` directory, and would then retrieve the PDF file, compress it, and name it as `result.pdf` in the same directory.
